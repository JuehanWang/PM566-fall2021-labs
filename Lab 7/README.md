## Learning goals

Use a real world API to make queries and process the data.

Use regular expressions to parse the information.

Practice your GitHub skills.

## Lab description

In this lab, we will be working with the NCBI API to make queries and
extract information using XML and regular expressions. For this lab, we
will be using the httr, xml2, and stringr R packages.

This markdown document should be rendered using github\_document
document.

### Question 1: How many sars-cov-2 papers?

Build an automatic counter of sars-cov-2 papers using PubMed. You will
need to apply XPath as we did during the lecture to extract the number
of results returned by PubMed in the following web address:

<https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=sars-cov-2>

Complete the lines of code:

``` r
# Downloading the website
website <- xml2::read_html("https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=sars-cov-2")

# Finding the counts
counts <- xml2::xml_find_first(website, "/html/body/main/div[9]/div[2]/div[2]/div[1]/span")

# Turning it into text
# or xml2::xml_text(counts)
counts <- as.character(counts)

# Extracting the data using regex
stringr::str_extract(counts, "[0-9,]+")
```

    ## [1] "114,592"

``` r
stringr::str_extract(counts, "[[:digit:],]+")
```

    ## [1] "114,592"

Question 2: Academic publications on COVID19 and Hawaii

You need to query the following The parameters passed to the query are
documented here.

Use the function httr::GET() to make the following query:

Baseline URL:
<https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi>

Query parameters:

db: pubmed term: covid19 hawaii retmax: 1000

``` r
library(httr)
query_ids <- GET(
  url    = "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi",
  query  = list(db = "pubmed",
  term   = "covid19 hawaii",
  retmax = 1000)
)
# or
query_ids <- GET(
  url    = "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/",
  path   = "entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi",
  query  = list(db = "pubmed",
  term   = "covid19 hawaii",
  retmax = 1000)
)
# Extracting the content of the response of GET
ids <- httr::content(query_ids)
```

The query will return an XML object, we can turn it into a character
list to analyze the text directly with as.character(). Another way of
processing the data could be using lists with the function
xml2::as\_list(). We will skip the latter for now.

Take a look at the data, and continue with the next question (donâ€™t
forget to commit and push your results to your GitHub repo!).
