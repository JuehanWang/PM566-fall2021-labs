```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Setup in R

Load the data.table (and the dtplyr and dplyr packages if you plan to work with those).

Load the met data from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/master/02_met/met_all.gz, and also the station data. For the later, you can use the code we used during lecture to pre-process the stations data:

```{r stations-data, cache=TRUE}
# Download the data
stations <- fread("ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-history.csv")
stations[, USAF := as.integer(USAF)]

# Dealing with NAs and 999999
stations[, USAF   := fifelse(USAF == 999999, NA_integer_, USAF)]
stations[, CTRY   := fifelse(CTRY == "", NA_character_, CTRY)]
stations[, STATE  := fifelse(STATE == "", NA_character_, STATE)]

# Selecting the three relevant columns, and keeping unique records
stations <- unique(stations[, list(USAF, CTRY, STATE)])

# Dropping NAs
stations <- stations[!is.na(USAF)]

# Removing duplicates
stations[, n := 1:.N, by = .(USAF)]
stations <- stations[n == 1,][, n := NULL]
```

```{r met-data, cache=TRUE}
if (!file.exists("met_all.gz"))
  download.file(
    url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/master/02_met/met_all.gz",
    destfile = "met_all.gz",
    method   = "libcurl",
    timeout  = 60
    )
met <- data.table::fread("met_all.gz")
```

```{r merging}
met <- merge(
  x = met,
  y = stations,
  all.x = TRUE, all.y = FALSE,
  by.x = "USAFID", by.y = "USAF"
)
```


### Question 1: Representative station for the US

What is the median station in terms of temperature, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure? Look for the three weather stations that best represent continental US using the quantile() function. Do these three coincide?

Knit the document, commit your changes, and Save it on GitHub. Don’t forget to add README.md to the tree, the first time you render it.

```{r collapsing-by-station}
station_averages <- met[,.(
  temp = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE),
  wind.sp = mean(wind.sp, na.rm = TRUE),
  atm.press = mean(atm.press, na.rm = TRUE)
), by = USAFID]
```

```{r quantile}
medians <- station_averages[, .(
  temp_50 = quantile(temp, probs = .5, na.rm = TRUE),
  wind.sp_50 = quantile(wind.sp, probs = .5, na.rm = TRUE),
  atm.press_50 = quantile(atm.press, probs = .5, na.rm = TRUE)
)] ;medians
```

Now we can find stations that are the closest to these. (hint: `which.min()`).

```{r medians-temp}
station_averages[, temp_dist := abs(temp - medians$temp_50)]
median_temp_station <- station_averages[order(temp_dist)][1]; median_temp_station
```

The median temperature station is `r median_temp_station$USAFID`.

```{r medians-wind.sp}
station_averages[, wind.sp_dist := abs(temp - medians$temp_50)]
median_wind.sp_station <- station_averages[order(wind.sp_dist)][1]; median_wind.sp_station
```

The median wind speed station is `r median_wind.sp_station$USAFID`.

```{r medians-atm.press}
station_averages[, atm.press_dist := abs(atm.press - medians$atm.press_50)]
median_atm.press_station <- station_averages[order(atm.press_dist)][1]; median_atm.press_station
```

The median atmospheric pressure station is `r median_atm.press_station$USAFID`.

### Question 2: Representative station per state

Just like the previous question, you are asked to identify what is the most representative, the median, station per state. This time, instead of looking at one variable at a time, look at the euclidean distance. If multiple stations show in the median, select the one located at the lowest latitude.

Knit the doc and save it on GitHub.


We first need to recover the state variable, by MERGING.

```{r recover-state-merge}
station_averages[, temp_50 := quantile(temp, probs = .5, na.rm = TRUE)]
station_averages <- merge(
  x = station_averages, y = stations, 
  by.x = "USAFID", by.y = "USAF", 
  all.x = TRUE, all.y = FALSE
  ); head(station_averages)
```

Now we can compute the median per state.

```{r median}
station_averages[, temp_50 := quantile(temp, probs = .5, na.rm = TRUE), by = STATE]
station_averages[, wind.sp_50 := quantile(wind.sp, probs = .5, na.rm = TRUE), by = STATE]
station_averages[, atm.press_50 := quantile(atm.press, probs = .5, na.rm = TRUE), by = STATE]
head(station_averages)
```

Now, the euclidean distance is calculated by $\sqrt{\sum_i(x_i - y_i)^2}$.

```{r euclidean-distance-temp-wind.sp}
station_averages[, eudist_temp_wind.sp := sqrt(
  (temp - temp_50)^2 + (wind.sp - wind.sp_50)^2
  )]; station_averages
```

```{r euclidean-distance-temp-atm.press}
station_averages[, eudist_temp_atm.press := sqrt(
  (temp - temp_50)^2 + (atm.press - atm.press_50)^2
  )]; station_averages
```

```{r euclidean-distance-wind.sp-atm.press}
station_averages[, eudist_wind.sp_atm.press := sqrt(
  (wind.sp - wind.sp_50)^2 + (atm.press - atm.press_50)^2
  )]; station_averages
```

Then, we need to recover the lat variable, by MERGING.

```{r recover-lat-merge}
met_lat <- distinct(met,USAFID,lat)

station_averages_rep <- merge(
  x = station_averages,
  y = met_lat,
  all.x = TRUE, all.y = FALSE,
  by.x = "USAFID", by.y = "USAFID"
)
```

We decide the most representative station per state by calculating the sum of the euclidean distance between each two of temperature, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.

```{r representative-stations-state}
station_averages_rep <- station_averages_rep %>% mutate(eudist_sum = rowSums(cbind(eudist_temp_wind.sp, eudist_temp_atm.press, eudist_wind.sp_atm.press), na.rm = TRUE))

station_averages_rep <- station_averages_rep[order(eudist_sum,lat)]; station_averages_rep
station_averages_rep <- station_averages_rep %>% group_by(STATE) %>% filter(row_number(STATE) == 1)
station_averages_rep_table <- station_averages_rep[-c(1:9,11:14), c("USAFID","STATE","eudist_sum")]; station_averages_rep_table
```

Finally, we get the most representative, the median, station per state.

### Question 3: In the middle?

For each state, identify what is the station that is closest to the mid-point of the state. Combining these with the stations you identified in the previous question, use leaflet() to visualize all ~100 points in the same figure, applying different colors for those identified in this question.

Knit the doc and save it on GitHub.

```{r mid-point}
met[, lat_50 := quantile(lat, probs = .5, na.rm = TRUE), by = STATE]
met[, lon_50 := quantile(lon, probs = .5, na.rm = TRUE), by = STATE]
```

```{r recover-lat-lon-merge}
met_lat_lon <- distinct(met,USAFID,STATE,lat,lon,lat_50,lon_50)

station_midpoint <- merge(
  x = station_averages,
  y = met_lat_lon,
  all.x = TRUE, all.y = FALSE,
  by = "USAFID"
)
names(station_midpoint)[names(station_midpoint) == 'STATE.x'] <- 'STATE'
```

Now, the euclidean distance is calculated by $\sqrt{\sum_i(x_i - y_i)^2}$.

```{r euclidean-distance-lat-lon}
station_midpoint[, eudist_lat_lon := sqrt(
  (lat - lat_50)^2 + (lon - lon_50)^2
  )]; station_midpoint
```

```{r midpoint-stations}
station_midpoint <- station_midpoint[order(station_midpoint$eudist_lat_lon)]
station_midpoint <- station_midpoint %>% group_by(STATE) %>% filter(row_number(STATE) == 1); station_midpoint
station_midpoint_table <- station_midpoint[, c("USAFID","STATE","eudist_lat_lon")]; station_midpoint_table
```

Therefore, we get the station that is closest to the mid-point of the state.

```{r figure}
# median_temp_station
# median_wind.sp_station
# median_atm.press_station
# station_averages_rep_table
# station_midpoint_table

stations <- unique(c(median_temp_station$USAFID,median_wind.sp_station$USAFID,median_atm.press_station$USAFID,station_averages_rep_table$USAFID,station_midpoint_table$USAFID))

met_stations <- distinct(subset(met, USAFID %in% c(stations))[,c("USAFID","lat","lon")])

if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
  leaflet(met_stations) %>%
   addProviderTiles('CartoDB.Positron') %>%
   addCircles(
   lat = ~lat, lng=~lon,
                                                
   #label = ~paste0(round(rh,2), ' rh'),
   #color = ~ temp.pal(rh),
   opacity = 1, fillOpacity = 1, radius = 500
     ) %>%
   # And a pretty legend
   addLegend('bottomleft', pal=temp.pal, values=met_avg$rh,
           title='Temperature, C', opacity=1)
} else {
  message("Sorry! No HTML.")
}
```




### Question 4: Means of means

Using the quantile() function, generate a summary table that shows the number of states included, average temperature, wind-speed, and atmospheric pressure by the variable “average temperature level,” which you’ll need to create.

Start by computing the states’ average temperature. Use that measurement to classify them according to the following criteria:

low: temp < 20
Mid: temp >= 20 and temp < 25
High: temp >= 25
Once you are done with that, you can compute the following:

Number of entries (records),
Number of NA entries,
Number of stations,
Number of states included, and
Mean temperature, wind-speed, and atmospheric pressure.
All by the levels described before.

```{r}
met[, state_temp := mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), by = STATE]
met[, temp_cat := fifelse(
  state_temp < 20, "low-temp",
  fifelse(state_temp < 25, "mid-temp","high-temp")
)]
```

Let's make sure that we don't have NAs.

```{r}
table(met$temp_cat, useNA = "always")
```

Now, let's summarize.

```{r}
tab <- met[, .(
  N_entries = .N,
  N_entries_NA = sum(is.na(temp_cat)),
  N_stations = length(unique(USAFID)),
  N_states = length(unique(STATE)),
  Mean_temp = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE),
  Mean_wind.sp = mean(wind.sp, na.rm = TRUE),
  Mean_atm.press = mean(atm.press, na.rm = TRUE)
), by = temp_cat]

knitr::kable(tab)
```
